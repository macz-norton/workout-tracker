## Description

The Workout Tracker is an app that allows users to track their resistance and cardio workouts. The application is deployed on Heroku, connects to a MongoDB database using a Mongoose schema, and handles routes with Express.

```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. 
I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 
I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. 
If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```
